# rusty

This is just a test of how to use Neon in order to build a native Node Addon written in Rust.

The project is composed by:

1. A native Node Addon called `rusty`.
1. A simple Node script called `node-rusty` for testing the previous addon purposes.

## How to build it

Go to `node-rusty` (where the test script is located) and do `npm install`. After that, just execute `node .` and see the result:
